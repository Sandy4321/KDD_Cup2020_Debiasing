## Schedule

**[Important]** Your ndcg@50_full for phase 7,8,9 need to be higher than or equal to **rank 65** in order to be qualified.

- 2020-06-04 10:30: There are about 650 teams who have submitted valid predictions, i.e. scores > 0, for phase 0-6. You therefore need to be the top 65 teams to be in the top 10%.

Phase 7,8,9 are postponed from May 22-Jun 11 to Jun 5-Jun 11. We make the change to the schedule because:

- We received tons of emails that express concerns about cheating and ask us to NOT show the scores when we are in the final stage (phase 7,8,9). And we agreed with the proposal and decided to not show the scores after June 5.
- Many people say that they are not ready yet and want to keep improving their results on the development set (phase 0-6).

Note that the final leaderboard will take only phase T=7,8,9 into account when deciding the winning teams. That is, dataset A = phase 0,1,â€¦,6, while dataset B = 7,8,9. Three submissions per day for dataset A, and one submission per day for dataset B.

## FAQ

- **Q: Should our submitted file include our predictions for all underexpose_test_qtime-0,1,2,â€¦,T.csv when we're in phase T? Or just underexpose_test_qtime-T.csv?**
- A: Please make sure that your have read the official script for evaluation. In short, you should include your predictions for all underexpose_test_click-0,1,2,â€¦,T when in phase T. Note that we have ensured that each user_id will not appear in more than one phase. Therefore, you don't need to specify which phase each row of your submission is for. Each row of your submission should contain just one user_id, followed by 50 different item_ids.
- **Q: Why can't I find underexpose_test_qtime_with_answer-T.csv?**
- A: underexpose_test_qtime_with_answer-T.csv is the standard answer, which is of course not released. However, we do have released underexpose_test_qtime-T.csv, which contains the first column (user_id) and the third column (time) of underexpose_test_qtime_with_answer-T.csv.
- **Q: Can I use underexpose_train_click-9.csv and underexpose_test_click-9.csv as extra data, in addition to underexpose_train_click-7.csv, when making predictions for underexpose_test_qtime-7.csv?**
- A: Yes. You can always improve your predictions for phase T, even if we are already in phase T' > T.
- **Q: What data source? And what bias to reduce?**
- A: The data source is the click data in mobile taobao's recommendation system. The sampling procedure is almost totally random, except that we have added a few constraints. For example, each user or item should have at least more than X clicks if you look at the complete dataset, which involves many days. However, do note that an item can have even zero clicks until some day. We are focusing on the *exposure bias* in E-Comm RecSys. Not all bias in all applications, which is a goal impossible to achieve. Note that the data distribution may not be stable, though, since it is collected across many days.
- **Q: Why is the timestamp in (0.0, 1.0)?**
- A: The timestamp provided in the dataset is actually time=(unix_timestamp - random_number_1) / random_number_2. These two random numbers are kept the same for all clicks. The time orders of the clicks are therefore preserved.
- **Q: Maximum number of members per team?**
- A: Ten at the moment.
- **Q: How to win?**
- A: A team first need to be among the top 10% in terms of NDCG@50-full (aka. ndcg_50_full on the leaderboard) so as to be *qualified*. The winning teams will then be the *qualified* teams that achieve the best NDCG@50-rare (aka. ndcg_50_half on the leaderboard).
- **Q: Are the teams who have registered but have no submissions for dataset B counted when deciding the top 10%?**
- A: No. FYI, the number of qualified teams will be set to MAX(10, the number of teams among top 10%). *We will announce the exact rank you need to achieve in order to be qualified when phase 9 begins.*
- **Q: Are there overlapped (duplicate) data between phase T and phase T+1? Should I remove the duplicate data?**
- A: Yes. Roughly 2/3 data will be the same. You may need to remove them if you need to use more than two phases when making predictions for the present phase.
- **Q: If I score a very high NDCG@50-full that gets me into the top 10% but my NDCG@50-rare is pretty low. Then I make a trade-off b/w these 2 metrics and my new result scores a lower NDCG@50-FULL, which still gets me into the top 10%, but with a much higher NDCG@50-rare. Which one of these 2 results will be used as the final submission, since the leaderboard only shows the first one?**
- A: We only look at the results shown on the leaderboard. We won't change the leaderboard so that it sorts the scores by ndcg_50_half directly, because this design of sorting by ndcg_50_full is intended as a way to encourage you to *only submit one time in total for phase 9*. If you still need to adjust your algorithm when we are already in phase 9, then you are probably just overfitting the dataset. P.S.: Tianchi doesn't support limiting the total submit times directly at the moment. It only supports limiting the submit times *for each day*.
